"This is my first Git repository, featuring the code for a Snake-Water-Gun game. This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic hand game, similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. It serves as a great exercise in Python programming, logic building, and user interaction. Through this project, I aim to improve my coding skills and get familiar with version control using Git. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or contribute to make it even better!"
